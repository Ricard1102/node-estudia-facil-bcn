            The clinic has recently been refurbished with the patientâ€™s needs and comfort at the centre of the renovation. There is parking
            directly in front of the clinic, and the doorways have been widened to accommodate wheel chair access. We have
            tea and coffee making facilities and there are male, female and disabled toilets on site. The clinical room has
            been fitted with the latest state of the art equipment to comply with national regulations in health and safety.
            The treatment room has also been fitted with a monitor to enable patients to watch treatment as it is taking
            place.

            Today, the treatment of medical instruments and accessories is an indispensable part of quality assurance in medically-oriented
            practices. We aim to maintain the highest level of hygiene standards and have invested in the new Thermoclean
            which cleans all the equipment by removing protein deposits and debris using an enzymatic tablet. The instruments
            are then placed in a sealed pouch and placed in the new Euronda Autoclave which sterilises for 30 minutes at
            134 degrees. Floors are hoovered, and where applicable steam cleaned; the treatment couch is re-dressed in disposable
            covers after every appointment and all surface areas are cleaned with disposable disinfection wipes.
